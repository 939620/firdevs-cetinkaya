# Mobile Budgeting App - Monefy
## Task 1 ‚Äì Test Planning and Strategy

### 1. What types of testing would you perform on a mobile budgeting app like Monefy?
- Functional Testing  
- UI/UX Testing  
- Regression Testing  
- Performance Testing  
- Security Testing  
- Compatibility Testing  
- Localization Testing  
- Backup & Restore Testing

- Non-Functional Metrics (Performance, Memory)


## 2. How would you ensure test coverage?

- Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)
- Test Design Techniques (Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value, etc.)
- Risk-Based Testing
- Automation for repetitive tasks
- Peer reviews and test audits

## 3. How would you approach writing automation tests for the app?

- Use Robot Framework with Appium for mobile automation
- Organize code with Page Object Model (POM)
- Include data-driven tests
- Use CI/CD for automatic runs (GitHub Actions or Jenkins)
- Separate keywords, resources, and test cases

## 4. What challenges would you anticipate?

- Frequent UI changes affecting test scripts
- Device/OS fragmentation
- Sync issues due to async operations
- Network dependency
- Handling sensitive user data securely

## 5. How would you prioritize test cases?

1. Core functions (adding expense/income)
2. Data sync & backups
3. User preferences/settings
4. Negative & boundary tests
5. Cross-device compatibility

## Bug - iOS
## 1: Currency Change Doesn't Affect Totals Correctly

Severity: High

Steps to reproduce:

Go to Settings ‚Üí Change Currency
Return to main screen/chart
Totals do not reflect converted values

Impact: Misleading financial data, trust issue

## 2: Language Switch Requires App Restart

Severity: Medium

Steps to Reproduce:

Go to Settings ‚Üí Change Language
Observe that language remains unchanged

Expected Result:
UI language updates instantly or with clear prompt to restart

Actual Result:
Language remains the same unless the app is killed and restarted
Impact: Poor localization UX, inconsistent experience


## 3: Leading Zeros Allowed in Account Balance Input

Severity : Low 

Steps to Reproduce:

Go to Edit Account screen
Tap on ‚ÄúInitial account balance‚Äù
Enter a value like ‚Äú00080‚Äù
Tap "Done"

Expected Result:
The input should auto-correct to ‚Äú80‚Äù or disallow leading zeros.

Actual Result:
App accepts and saves ‚Äú00080‚Äù as the value, which may cause confusion or inconsistencies in data handling.

Impact:It's more of a UI/UX polish issue.
